In this project, data from Kaggle that contained Spotify top 50 songs in 2021. 
#I used the data to create my own table: 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#I then used the data base to create my own questions and wrote SQL to solve them. 

1. What song has the highest popularity? Who was the artist? What was the danceability? 
select MAX(popularity), danceability, artist_name, track_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by MAX(Popularity) desc
limit 1; 


2. Top 10 artist by popularity: 
select popularity, artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name 
order by popularity desc
limit 10; 

3. What is the shortest song, and who sang it? 
select MIN(duration_ms), track_name, artist_name
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata; 

4. What is the average song length? 
select AVG(duration_ms) from BIT_DB. Spotifydata;
