# I downloaded a database from Chinook containing 11 tables regarding music data and sales.

# 1. First I created a table linking the artist to their album.
select artists.Name, albums.Title 
FROM  chinook.albums as albums
join chinook.artists as artists
on albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId; 

# 2. How many customers are from the USA?
select count(CustomerId) from chinook.customers 
where country = "USA"; 

# 3. Show customers including their name, customer id and country who are not in the USA. 
select c.CustomerId, c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Country 
from chinook.customers as c  
where country !="USA"; 

# 4. How many sales were there in 2013? 
select count(InvoiceId) from chinook.invoices 
where "InvoiceDate" like '%2013%'; 

# 5. What was the total of all sales in 2013? 
select sum(Total) from chinook.invoices 
where "InvoiceDate" like '%2013%'; 

# 6. List the names and emails of all managers and sales support agents. 
select e.Title, e.LastName, e.FirstName, e.Email 
from chinook.employees as e 
where 
    e.Title like '%Manager%'; 
    

# 7. Total sales made by each agent?
select e.LastName, e.FirstName, Round(SUM(i.Total), 2) 
from chinook.employees as e
join chinook.customers as c
on c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
join chinook.invoices as i
on i.CustomerId=c.CustomerID
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.FirstName;
;
